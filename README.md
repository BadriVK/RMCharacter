The Rick and Morty Character App

## Technology

## Xcode Editor
This Project developed on Xcode 13.2.1

## Project Architecture
This Project is using MVVM architecture

## API Reference
This project makes use of the [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to get characters. You can test query statements on the [Rick and Morty Console](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation).

## Tests
This is the first time when I get the requirement of unit test cases writting and I dont have previous experience with this so I will take time to learn and start with it.
One of the biggest idea for having MVVM is that most of data flow can be testable. Data binding in view layer by SwiftUI is awesome. However, this project has view model layer to make it testable as much as possible.
